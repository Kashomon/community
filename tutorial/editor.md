# Editors

There are several different editors people use:

- [Vim](#vim)
- [VSCode](#vscode)

It's worth finding somebody in Otrego who's already using the editor you're
interested in using and asking them how they've configured their editor.

- [vimtutor](https://superuser.com/questions/246487/how-to-use-vimtutor) --
  still the best introduction to basic vim functionality.
- [openvim.com](https://openvim.com/) has a nice vimtutor-like experience on the web.
- Plugins Manager: A plugin manager is basically required to have a good Vim
  experience. There are several good options to choose from. There's a useful (although somewhat dated) discussion on
  [Stack Overflow](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/388/what-is-the-difference-between-the-vim-plugin-managers).
  - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) -- A very popular plugin
    manager (@Kashomon uses it), and it works quite well. Like `apt` for Vim.
    In maintenance mode, but still works quite well.
  - [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) -- Another very popular
    plugin manager like Vundle, but is still maintained.
  - [Vim8 Plugins](https://medium.com/@paulodiovani/installing-vim-8-plugins-with-the-native-pack-system-39b71c351fea) --
    Vim8 now has plugin-logic built into the system. It's a bit manual compared
    to Vundle or VimPlug, but it works quite well.
